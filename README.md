- Hello, Iâ€™m @MitchWSmith
- Welcome to my ReadMe. I'm a computer technician but also a lot more.
- I build computers ranging from gaming PCs to HTPCs, and I am the system administrator for enterprise Linux(Rocky 9) servers that I use for webhosting and running video game servers.
- I've worked as a team lead in multiple enviroments and I also have 3 years of customer service experience from my time at Chick-Fil-A.
- Fun facts: I've built over 30 PCs for friends and clients. I've previously voluteered at Free I.T. Athens to clean, refurbish, and then revive donated computers with Linux Mint. I sell a photography calendar I made on one of my websites.
- Fun facts continued: My photography has over 3 million views online. A Steam Workshop video game map I've made has over 9000 downloads.


- How to reach me: Add Mail@ to MitchWSmith and then put a .com behind it! Bots please ignore ;P
